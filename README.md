# Start Here
Welcome to the Data Engineering 101 Pre-Enrollment course! We'll call it DE101 for short.

## Overview

The purpose of this pre-enrollment course is to:
- Give you an idea of what bootcamp is like.
- Get your computer set up for bootcamp.
- Introduce you to basic programming skills and ideas.
- Show us at Data Stack Academy that you're committed.

If you're applying for a bootcamp scholarship, the code you write in this course will be used for that, too.

**Attending DE101 is required for enrollment in Date Engineering Bootcamp**

Everything you'll need is in this GitHub repository, also called a 'repo'. It's like an interactive textbook.

## What This Course Covers
The Data Engineering 101 Pre-Enrollment course is a gentle introduction to:
- The Python programming language. Python is often used in data engineering jobs, and it's the language we use in bootcamp.
- Setting up and using a coding environment. There are a lot to choose from, but we'll use VSCode.
- Using Git to have several different versions of a code poject.
- Using GitHub to share code and collaborate.
- The command line. This is how pros interact with their operating systems.
- The vocabulary and concepts you'll use as a data engineer.

## Schedule
DE101 is a two-week course. It starts three weeks before the Data Engineering Bootcamp course begins, so you'll have a week break. 

DE101 is taught live 8:30am-11:30am PST. Missing more than two hours of the course might disqualify you for enrolling in the bootcamp, though you can request an exception.

Each class day has an episode. An episode is just a folder. It has all the instructions and exercises for that day.

We meet as a class Monday thru Thursday. Attendance isn't taken on Friday. Instead, you'll have that time to work on your code review (more on that later).

Classmates and teachers are available to help you during live class hours. Of course, you're welcome to work through the material any time.

## Let's Get Started!
