# Data Engineering 101 Code Review 1

Code reviews must be mailed to alma@datastack.academy by 5pm PST Saturday. 

Turning in this code review is how we'll count your attendance for today. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. 

Today's code review will let you show off your understanding of Python basics: functions, flow control, and data types. 

### Instructions
- Make sure your repository includes a completed `.gitignore`, a `requirements.txt`, and a `README`.
- In a Python file (`.py`) or a notebook (`.pynb`) called `main`:
    - Write a function called `plus_three` that takes an argument, adds three to it, and returns the sum. 
    - Call `plus_three` twice, with a different argument each time.
    - Write a function called `weather_report`. In the body of `weather_report`, assign the value `f"Today is {first_argument} and {second_argument}"` to a variable called `today`. Return `today`.
    - Call `weather_report`.
    - Make a tuple called `top_ten` that contains the numbers 1 thru 10.
    - Write a `for` loop that multiples each number in `top_ten` by itself and prints the product.
    - Write an `if` statement that check whether the number 7 is in `top_ten`. If it is, print the string `"We have a 7"`. Otherwise, print `"No 7 here"`.

- Push all your code to a new public repository on your GitHub called 'DE 101 Code Review 2'
- Make at least three commits on the repository


### Accepting Criteria
In order for the code review to pass, it has to include:
- An informative README
- A `.gitignore` file
- A  `requirements.txt`
- A file called either `main.py` or `main.ipynb`
- A function called `plus_three` that's been called twice
- A function called `weather_report` and a function call for it
- A tuple called `top_ten`
- An `if` statement that check whether the number 7 is in `top_ten`
- A `for` loop that multiples each number in `top_ten` by itself
- At least three commits. 

Email a link to your 'DE 101 Code Review 2' GitHub repository to alma@datastack.academy by 5pm PST Saturday. Give the email the subject line 'DE 101 Code Review 2'.
