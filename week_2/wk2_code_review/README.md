# Data Engineering 101 Code Review 1

Code reviews must be mailed to hello@datastack.academy by 5pm PST Saturday. 

Turning in this code review is how we'll count your attendance for today. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. 

Today's code review will let you show off your understanding of Python basics: functions, flow control, and data types. 

### Instructions
- Push all your code to a new public repository on your GitHub called 'DE101-Code-Review-2'.
- Make at least three commits on the repository.
- Make sure your repository includes a completed `.gitignore`, a `requirements.txt`, and a `README.md`.
- In a Python file (`.py`) or a notebook (`.ipynb`) called `main`:
    - Write a function called `plus_three` that takes an argument, adds three to it, and returns the sum. 
    - Call `plus_three` twice, with a different argument each time.
    - Write a function called `weather_report`. It should take two arguments, `weather_1` and `weather_2`. In the body of `weather_report`, assign the value `f"Today is {weather_1} and {weather_2}"` to a variable called `today`. Return `today`.
    - Call `weather_report`.
    - Make a tuple called `top_ten` that contains the numbers 1 thru 10.
    - Write a `for` loop that multiples each number in `top_ten` by itself and prints the product.
    - Write an `if` statement that check whether the number 7 is in `top_ten`. If it is, print the string `"We have a 7"`. Otherwise, print `"No 7 here"`.




### Accepting Criteria
In order for the code review to pass, it has to include:
- An informative `README.md`
- A `.gitignore` file
- A  `requirements.txt`
- A file called either `main.py` or `main.ipynb`
- A function called `plus_three` that's been called twice
- A function called `weather_report` and a function call for it
- A tuple called `top_ten`
- An `if` statement that check whether the number 7 is in `top_ten`
- A `for` loop that multiples each number in `top_ten` by itself
- At least three commits. 

Email a link to your 'DE101-Code-Review-2' GitHub repository to hello@datastack.academy by 5pm PST Saturday. Give the email the subject line 'DE101-Code-Review-2'.
