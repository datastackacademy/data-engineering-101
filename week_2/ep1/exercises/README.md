## More Practice

With this string:
```python
zen_of_python_2 = "  expLiciT is BetteRer than ImplIcit  \n"
```

    1) remove the leading and trailing whitespace, and the newline
    2) make all the letter lowercase except the first letter
    3) replace the word "betterer" with "better"

With these variables:
```python
genus = "querus"
species = "muehlenbergii"
```
    1) capitalize the name of the genus
    2) create a new variable called "scientific_name". Assign it the value of the genus and species concatenated together, with a space between
    3) use an f-string to print a sentence saying what the scientific name is (this is the name of Chinkapin oaks, by the way)

With these lists:
```python
favorite_dogs = ["Sweet_Potato", "Scruffles", "Nolty", "Lucky"]
new_dogs = ["Larry", "Toaster", "Dr_Dog"]
```
    1) remove the last dog from the `new_dogs` list
    2) combine the two lists
    3) add a new dog to the combined list
    4) check whether "Sweet_Potato" is in the list
    5) slice the list so it only includes the second, third, and fourth dogs

Given the following list: 
```python
my_list = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]
```
    1. output every other element in the list, starting with the first element
    1. print the list in reverse
    1. Append the number 50 to the right side of the list; append the number 0 to the left side
    1. Starting from the third list element (15), print the next four elements in the list


With this dictionary:
```python
piece_values = {"knight": 3, "bishop": 3, "rook": 5, "queen": 9}
```
    1) get the value of a bishop
    2) add a new key-value pair that has "pawn" as the key, and 1 as the value
    3) use `pop()` to remove a key of "horse" if "horse" is in the dictionary, and return a value of None if it isn't
    4) get the length of the dictionary
    5) show all the keys in the `piece_values` dictionary, then all the values
    6) check whether 8 is a value in the dict
    7) bonus: use arithmetic to sum the value of a knight and two rooks

Given the following lists:
```python
keys = [10,20,30,40,50]
values = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty', 'Forty', 'Fifty']
```
    Convert the lists to a dictionary where the keys are items from the first list, and the values are items from the second.

    Hint: First check if the two list have equal length. Use a `for` loop with `range()` to traverse the list and create your dict.

Given the following dictionaries:
```python
dict1={1: 10, 2: 20}
dict2={3: 30, 4: 40}
dict3={5: 50, 6: 60}
```
    Concatenate them into a new dictionary called `dict4`.
