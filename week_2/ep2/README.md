# Python Functions
## Functions
Python functions define a block of code that can be called and run by name. Functions are one of the most common features in all modern programming languages. The ability to define a portion of code and call it by name makes code much more compact and reusable (since it only has to be updated in one place, the function definition, rather than every place the function is called). A function can accept inputs and can return values. 

Go to `01_functions.ipynb` in the `notebooks` folder to learn more about functions. Remember that you'll need Jupyter installed in your virtual environment before you can run the notebook.

## Goals for Today
