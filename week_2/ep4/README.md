# GitHub for Collaboration

When collaborating with a team, good communication can save you a lot of trouble. Scrum meetings are a great time for each person on a development team to say what they'll be working on that day, so people aren't simultaneously changing the same file. Writing useful commit messages will also help communicate your intentions to your peers.

GitHub can also be social! If you're looking for some code inspiration, [explore public repositories by topic](https://github.com/topics), or follow your friends and see what kinds of projects they're making.
