# Setting up VS Code and Installing Requirements

Yesterday, we used Google Colab to get a taste of Python. Colab is convenient, but not great for the kind of complex programs data engineers use. Today, we'll do the setup needed to write professional-level programs on our own computers.

Carefully follow the instructions in [system_setup.md](system_setup.md). It's a lot, but it'll be worth it later. If you start getting overwhelmed, slow down, and remember that your teachers and classmates are here to help.

We'll talk about how and why to use these tools as we go along. For now, we'll just focus on getting everything working.

## Goals for Today
- Do the installations and configurations needed to get your system ready for data engineering.
- Successfully run the 'Getting Started Test' at the end of 'system_setup.md'.
