# Welcome to Python
Code is a set of instructions, and there are a lot of language you can use to write it. So, why Python?

Python is:
- Widely used in data engineering.
- Supported by a large online community.
- Easy to read and debug.
- Actually pretty fun, once you get the hang of it.


## Google Colab
In bootcamp, and in the rest of this course, we'll write Python in an application called VS Code. For today we'll use Google Colab.

Colab lets you:
- Include blocks of text, called 'Markdown', throughout your code.
- Write code in cells, so you can run a single cell or a whole program.
- Start using Python without setting up a local environment.

The Python tutorial we use today is adapted from the [Data Stack Academy 5 Day Python Challenge](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FxlXQNr1bgL67o5PcxNDTkRHqhiOLPRR?usp=share_link). 

Log into a Google account, then [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d-kGaUWYM7SfM38LOOBXvV6ETQH0BQ2n?usp=sharing) to open notebook 1, where you can find lessons on the basics of Python and notebooks. Then you can keep going in [notebook 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JyqPk1WabYuac9Himwo4bnF_e8ms4-fS?usp=sharing) to learn the more advanced concept of the dictionary data structure.


## Goals for Today
- Start learning the very basics of Python
- Get familiar with Colab
