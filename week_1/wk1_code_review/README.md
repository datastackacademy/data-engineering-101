# Data Engineering 101 Code Review 1

Every Friday in bootcamp, you'll have a code review to show that you've learned the skills for that week. Normally, they're not visible til that day. 

Code reviews are due at 5pm PST the next day (Saturday). You can find more details about the code reviews in bootcamp in the ['Course Syllabus and Policies'](https://datastack.academy/course-syllabus-and-policies/).

Turning in this code review is how we'll count your attendance for today. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. 

## Overview
Today's code review has two parts.

For the first part, you'll make a GitHub repository with the usual setup files and some basic Python code. 

For the second part, you'll have a quiz on Data Stack Academy's ['Course Syllabus and Policies'](https://datastack.academy/course-syllabus-and-policies/)

## Part 1: Python and GitHub
The project should be well-commented, without unused code.

### Instructions
- Make a new public repository on your GitHub called 'DE 101 Code Review 1'
- The repository should include:
    - A `.gitignore` file with whatever you want to exclude from Git
    - A `README.md` with at least a brief description of the project, instructions for setup, and a license
    - A  `requirements.txt` with jupyterlab at version 3.3.2
    - A `main` file for your code. This can either be a Python file (`.py`) or a notebook (`.ipynb`)
- In the file called `main`:
    - Make a list called `grab_bag` that contains a float, a string, and an integer
    - Make a dictionary called `puppies`. Give it three key-value pairs. The keys should be names as strings, and the values should be ages as integers
    - Print the keys in the `puppies` dictionary
- Make at least three commits on the repository

## Part 2: Bootcamp Policies

### Accepting Criteria
In order for the code review to pass, it has to include:
- An informative README
- A `.gitignore` file
- A  `requirements.txt`
- A file called either `main.py` or `main.ipynb`
- A list called `grab_bag`
- A dictionary called `puppies`
- Code that will print the keys in the `puppies` dictionary
- At least three commits. 

Email a link to your 'DE 101 Code Review 1' GitHub repository to alma@datastack.academy by 5pm PST Saturday. Give the email the subject line 'DE 101 Code Review 1'.
