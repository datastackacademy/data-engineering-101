# Putting It All Together
This week we've started learning Python, VS Code, and GitHub. Today, we'll pull it all together.

We're going to create a project for practicing this week's skills. It's a lot like what you'll do for the code review tomorrow.

## Goals for Today
- Practice skills Python, VS Code, and GitHub
- Practice using Git branches
