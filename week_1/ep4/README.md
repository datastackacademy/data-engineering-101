# Putting It All Together, and the Student Handbook
This week we've started learning Python, VS Code, and GitHub. Today, we'll pull it all together. It's a lot like what you'll do for the code review tomorrow.

When you're done with the code and GitHub practice, take some time to read Data Stack Academy's ['Course Syllabus and Policies'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-k3e7yBTYhT00aO3yYzlBqNF37SpIKuF-swhT1kNxwk/edit?usp=sharing). This will prepare you for the rules and rhythms of bootcamp. There'll be a short quiz on it as part of the tomorrow's code review.

## Putting It All Together: Python, VS Code, and GitHub
We're going to create a project for practicing this week's skills. 

Be sure to include:
- A `main.py` file for your code.
- A `.gitignore` file that excludes the virtual environment from Git.
- A `requirements.txt` file. It can be empty for this project.
- A `README.md` file, that introduces the project.

As a reminder, the general steps are:
1. Making the repo and files locally.
2. Activating the virtual environment (we'd also install the requirements now, if there were any).
3. Initializing a Git Repository.
4. Writing, saving, and committing changes to the local files.
5. Creating a remote repository on GitHub and pushing the local repository to it.

Repeat the writing, committing, and pushing steps as many times as you need.

In this episode 4 folder, you'll find the file `python_challenge.md`. It has instructions for the code to include in your project. 

## Data Stack Academy Student Handbook
The goal of this pre-enrollment course is to get you ready for bootcamp. Please read through the ['Course Syllabus and Policies'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-k3e7yBTYhT00aO3yYzlBqNF37SpIKuF-swhT1kNxwk/edit?usp=sharing) so you know what to expect. 

## Goals for Today
- Practice using Python, VS Code, Git, and GitHub
- Get familiar with the course policies for bootcamp
