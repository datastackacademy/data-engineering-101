# Putting It All Together, and the Student Handbook
This week we've started learning Python, VS Code, and GitHub. Today, we'll pull it all together.

We're going to create a project for practicing this week's skills. It's a lot like what you'll do for the code review tomorrow.

Be sure to include:
- A `main.py` file for your code.
- A `.gitignore` file that excludes the virtual environment from Git.
- A `requirements.txt` file. It can be empty for this project.
- A `README.md` file, that introduces the project.

As a reminder, the general steps are:
1. Making the repo and files locally.
2. Activating the virtual environment (we'd also install the requirements now, if there were any).
3. Initializing a Git Repository.
4. Writing, saving, and committing changes to the local files.
5. Creating a remote repository on GitHub and pushing the local repository to it.

Repeat the writing, commiting, and pushing steps as many times as you need.

In this episode 4 folder, you'll find the file `python_challenge.md`. It has instructions for the code to include in your project. 

## Goals for Today
- Practice skills for Python, VS Code, and GitHub
- Practice using Git branches
