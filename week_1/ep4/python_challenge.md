# Practice Python Challenge: Taco Time

Remember to save and commit your code often!

On your `main` branch, in a `.py` file:
1. Make a variable containing the name of a vegetable as a string. 
1. Make another vegetable variable.
1. Make a list called `taco` containing the two variables you just made.
1. Use `append()` to add another ingredient to your taco ingredient list.
1. Assign the list `['onions', 'candy corn']` to the variable `extras`.
1. Use `extend()` to add `extras` to your `taco` list.
1. Wait, candy corn? Use `remove()` to get rid of that candy corn.
1. Print the first two items of `taco` (use list slicing).

Start a taco repository on GitHub. Push the code in your local `main` to the remote `main` in that repository.


Make a local branch called `taco_dict` off the local `main`. In the `taco_dict` branch:
1. Make a dictionary that has the values from your ingredient list as keys, and any integers you'd like as values. For example, the list `treats = ["ice_cream", "peanuts"]` could look like the dictionary `choco_taco = {"ice_cream": 1, "peanuts": 3}`.
1. Print the length of the dictionary.
1. Make a second dictionary that has 'mild', 'medium', and 'spicy' as the keys, and 'pico de gallo', 'salsa verde', and 'salsa roja' as the values.

Push your local `taco_dict` branch to a remote `taco_dict` branch. 

Merge the changes in the remote `taco_dict` branch into the remote `main` branch.

Pull the new changes in the remote `main` branch into the local `main` branch.

Keep practicing making changes on local branches, pushing them to remote branches, merging them the remote `main`, and pulling them back down to the local `main`. It doesn't really matter what code you add. The idea is to get comfortable with this flow, so that later you can focus on your code instead of wrangling GitHub.
